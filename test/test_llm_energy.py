Integration Tests for Neo4j-Powered Energy Dashboard Graph Schema

This test suite verifies the integrity of key relationships and data structures within a Neo4j graph database
that supports an Energy Management Dashboard. Each test ensures that the graph model is correctly populated
with meaningful and connected entities.

Tested Entities and Relationships:
- `Company` nodes and their `HAS_USER` relationships to `User` nodes
- `Site` nodes with associated `EnergyConsumption` via `HAS_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION` relationships
- `System` nodes and their linked `Device` nodes via `HAS_DEVICE`
- `User`-created `Vehicle` nodes via `CREATED_VEHICLE` relationships
- `Site` nodes containing `System` nodes via `HAS_SYSTEM` relationships

Features:
- Uses Neo4jâ€™s Python driver to query the graph
- Employs pytest-style class-based setup/teardown
- Verifies presence and integrity of connected nodes
- Confirms data existence and structure for a specific date (e.g., for energy reports)

Requirements:
- A running Neo4j instance at `bolt://localhost:7687`
- A populated graph with nodes: Company, User, Site, EnergyConsumption, System, Device, Vehicle
- Python environment with `neo4j` driver installed

Usage:
Run the tests using a test runner like pytest:
    pytest test_energy_dashboard.py

This test suite helps validate the correctness of graph migrations, seed data, or ETL pipelines
before using the graph data in production dashboards or analytical tools.
